# Human Activity Recognition using ResNet34

## Overview
This project aims to recognize human activities using the ResNet34 model for computer vision. We utilized the Kinetics400 dataset, which offers a diverse range of human actions captured in video format. By training the ResNet34 architecture on this dataset, we achieved robust performance in accurately identifying various human activities.

## Requirements
